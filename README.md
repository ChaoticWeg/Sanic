# Sanic

A Stardew Valley mod that allows the player to sprint using the spacebar.

### How to sprint

Hold spacebar.

### What does sprinting do?

Doubles base movement speed while slowly depleting energy.

### But what does sprinting _really_ do?

Doubles base movement speed while spacebar is held (and left-shift is _not_ held), while removing 1% of max stamina every 90th tick (ideally, roughly each second-and-a-half of sprint time).

### Why is this README so short?

Yeah.
